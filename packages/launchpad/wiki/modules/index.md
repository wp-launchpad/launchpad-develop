Launchpad framework in its core philosophy tries to reduce its footprint.

Due to that instead of shipping a complete framework with every options by default, we are instead shipping the minimum for the framework to be usable.

Then we based the framework on a modular architecture breaking each functionnality into a separate package that contains only the logic for that module.

Due to that you will be able to only pick only modules you need each time you are working with Launchpad and you will be able to have an optimized build with only necessary code.
