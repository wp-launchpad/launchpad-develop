## Contribute

Launchpad is an open source project so anyone can contribute to it.

Contributing is even more important than this as it is what keeps the project alive.

## Companies

For companies, it is not yet possible to contribute by sponsoring the project.

Instead, it is possible to contribute by sponsoring some developers to work on the project or by allowing some of their developers to allocate a part of their working time on the project.

## Contributor

Contributing on Launchpad can take multiple forms which are all necessary to the good functioning of the project.

| Using the project                      | Development, Writing issues   | Writing issues based on your experience with the framework (bugs, difficulties) | Providing feedback is one of the most important thing for a project as it is the best way to correct errors or misunderstanding                       |
| Writing / correcting the documentation | Markdown, Git                 | Creating fork, Writing markdown, Creating pull request                          | The documentation is one of the hardest part of the project to maintain as an error can easily filter and adding fixes is always more than welcome    |
| Correcting bugs                        | PHP, Git, WordPress           | Creating fork, Writing tests, Writing code, Creating pull request               | Even if tests are done on the project some of them always pass the verifications. Fixing them is something that will help to stabilise the framework. |
| Implementing features                  | PHP, Git, WordPress, Markdown | Creating fork, Writing tests, Writing code, Creating pull request               | Adding new features is always the shinny part of development as they are often increasing the capacities from the framework                           |
| Creating a module                      | PHP, Git, WordPress, Composer | Creating repository, Writing tests, Writing code, Managing packagist            | Even if the core needs to remain as small as possible, modules are important to provide a variety of choice to developers using the framework         |
| Testing the project                    | PHP, Git, WordPress           | Manual testing, Maintaining specification                                       | Testing can seem boring but it is the key to have a stable framework on the long run                                                                  |
